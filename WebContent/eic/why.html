	        My attempt to approach this feeling we all have of being part of something bigger. 
	        During the last couple of centuries science has discovered that everything is closely related. 
	        It has come up with new ideas, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">Chaos Theory</a>, 
	        ecology, The Internet, social networks, etc. 
	        to keep us engaged and aware of these networks that exist between us. We also have discovered that these 
	        connections have profound consequences, and as we acknowledge them, we can tackle all kinds of problems. 
	        We are brought closer as we discover them. We find clues to mysteries, we share passion, opinions and 
	        responsibilities.

	        </span>
			<a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/">Wikipedia</a> is a huge knowledge network that houses information introduced 
			by millions around the world everyday. Using Wikipedia's public API I built a database of my own which would allow me to navigate through  
			immense amounts of information to find the paths through which everything is connected. I only downloaded 1 GB 
			or so of data, so the connections in here might seem a bit limited. The idea is to keep it growing.
			<p/>
<span class="title">
This experiment was made out of curiosity and for fun
	        </span>

			I don't earn any money with it, just some knowledge and awe with the discovery of networks I couldn't have imagined between 
			two seemingly unpaired things. For performance reasons I only take up to 5 degrees of separation into account. 
			There are probably more undiscovered connections than i can show on these experiment, but this was 
			thought as a weekend project and probably didn't work on it for more than a full 30 hours.
