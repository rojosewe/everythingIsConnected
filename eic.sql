Edison felt the commercial pressure for disc records, and by 1912, though reluctant at first, his movement to disc records was in full swing.  This was the [[Edison Disc Record]].'),
	(65, 'The 1920s brought improved [[radio]] technology and radio sales, bringing many phonograph dealers to near financial ruin. With efforts at improved audio fidelity, the big record companies succeeded in keeping business booming through the end of the decade, but the record sales plummeted during the [[Great Depression]], with many companies merging or going out of business.'),
	(66, 'Booms in record sales returned after [[World War II]] as standards changed from 78s to vinyl [[LP record|long play records]], which could contain an entire symphony, and 45s which usually contained one hit popularized on the radio, plus another song on the back or [[A-side and B-side|\\"flip\\" side]]. An \\"[[extended play]]\\" version of the 45 was also available, designated [[Gramophone record|45 EP]], which provided capacity for longer selections, or two regular-length songs per side.'),
	(67, 'By the 1960s, cheaper portable record players and record changers which played stacks of records in wooden console cabinets were popular, usually with heavy and crude [[Tonearm|tonearms]]. Even pharmacies stocked 45 rpm records at their front counters. Rock music played on 45s became the soundtrack to the 1960s as people bought the same songs that were played free of charge on the radio. Some record players were even tried in automobiles, but were quickly displaced by [[stereo 8|8-track]] and [[cassette tapes]].'),
	(68, 'High fidelity made great advances during the 1970s, as turntables became very precise instruments with belt or direct drive, jewel-balanced tonearms, some with electronically controlled linear tracking and magnetic cartridges. Some cartridges had frequency response above 30&nbsp;kHz for use with CD-4 [[quadraphonic]] 4 channel sound. A high fidelity component system which cost under $1000 could do a very good job of reproducing very accurate frequency response across the human audible spectrum from 20&nbsp;Hz to 20,000&nbsp;Hz with a $200 turntable which would typically have less than 0.05% [[Wow (recording)|wow]] and [[Flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]] and very low rumble (low frequency noise). A well-maintained record would have very little surface noise, though it was difficult to keep records completely free from scratches, which produced popping noises. Another characteristic failure mode was \'\'groove lock\'\', causing a section of music to repeat, separated by a popping noise. This was so common that a saying was coined: \'\'you sound like a broken record\'\', referring to someone who is being annoyingly repetitious.'),
	(69, 'Records themselves became an art form because of the large surface onto which graphics and books could be printed, and records could be molded into unusual shapes, colors, or with images (picture discs). The turntable remained a common element of home audio systems well after the introduction of other media such as audio [[magnetic tape]] and even the early years of the [[compact disc]] as a lower priced music format. However, even as the cost of producing CDs fell below that of records, CDs would remain a higher priced music format than cassettes or records. Thus, records were not uncommon in home audio systems into the early 1990s.'),
	(70, 'By the turn of the 21st century, the turntable had become a niche product, as the price of CD players, which reproduce music free from pops and scratches, fell far lower than high fidelity tape players or turntables. Nevertheless, there is some increase in interest as many big-box media stores stock turntables, as do professional DJ equipment stores. Most low-end and mid-range amplifiers omit the [[phono input]] but, on the other hand, low-end turntables with built-in phono pre-amplifiers are widely available. The list price of first-run CDs remains above $15, while used records are very inexpensive, and some are rare and sought after. Some combination systems include basic turntables with a CD and radio in retro-styled cabinets. Records also continue to be manufactured and sold today, albeit in very small quantities when compared to the disc phonograph\'s heyday.'),

	(72, '=== Turntable construction ===\\nInexpensive record players typically used a flanged steel stamping for the turntable structure.  A rubber disc would be secured to the top of the stamping to provide traction for the record, as well as a small amount of vibration isolation.   The spindle bearing usually consisted of a [[bronze]] [[plain bearing|bushing]].  The flange on the stamping provided a convenient place to drive the turntable by means of an \'\'idler wheel\'\' (see below).  While light and cheap to manufacture, these mechanisms had low [[inertia]], making motor speed instabilities more pronounced.'),
	(73, 'Costlier turntables made from heavy [[aluminium]] castings have greater balanced mass and inertia, helping minimize vibration at the stylus, and  maintaining constant speed without wow or flutter, even if the motor exhibits cogging effects.  Like stamped steel turntables, they were topped with rubber. Because of the increased mass, they usually employed [[ball bearing]]s or [[rolling-element bearing|roller bearings]] in the spindle to reduce friction and noise.  Most are belt or direct drive, but some use an idler wheel. A specific case was the Swiss [[LENCO Turntables|\\"Lenco\\"]] drive, which possessed a very heavy turntable coupled via an idler wheel to a long, tapered motor drive shaft. This enabled stepless rotation or speed control on the drive. Because of this feature the [[LENCO Turntables|Lenco]] became popular in the late 1950s with dancing schools, because the dancing instructor could lead the dancing exercises at different speeds.'),
	(74, 'Many modern players have platters with a continuous series of [[stroboscope|strobe]] markings machined or printed around their edge. Viewing these markings in artificial light at [[mains frequency]] produces a [[stroboscopic effect]], which can be used to verify proper rotational speed. Additionally, the edge of the turntable can contain magnetic markings to provide feedback pulses to an electronic speed-control system.'),
	(75, '==== Idler-wheel drive system ====\\nEarlier designs used a rubberized idler-wheel drive system. However, wear and decomposition of the wheel, as well as the direct mechanical coupling to a vibrating motor, introduced low-frequency noise (\\"[[Rumble measurement|rumble]]\\") and speed variations (\\"[[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[Flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]]\\") into the sound. These systems generally used a [[electric motor#Single-phase AC synchronous motors|synchronous motor]] which ran at a speed synchronized to the [[frequency]] of the [[alternating current|AC]] power supply.  Portable record players typically used an inexpensive [[shaded-pole synchronous motor|shaded-pole motor]]. At the end of the motor shaft there was a stepped driving capstan; to obtain different speeds, the rubber idler wheel was moved to contact different steps of this capstan. The idler was pinched against the bottom or inside edge of the platter to drive it.'),
	(76, 'Until the 1970s, the idler-wheel drive was the most common on turntables, except for higher-end audiophile models. However, even some higher-end turntables, such as the [[LENCO Turntables|Lenco]], [[Garrard Engineering and Manufacturing Company|Garrard]], [[Elektro-Mess-Technik|EMT]], and [[Dual (brand)|Dual]] turntables, used idler-wheel drive.'),
	(77, 'The \\"Acoustical professional\\" turntable (earlier marketed under Dutch \'\'\\"Jobo prof\\"\'\') of the 1960s however possessed an expensive German drive motor, the \'\'\\"Pabst Aussenl\\u00e4ufer\\"\'\' (\\"Pabst outrunner\\"). As this motor name implied, the rotor was on the outside of the motor and acted as a flywheel ahead of the belt-driven turntable itself. In combination with a steel to nylon turntable bearing (with [[molybdenum disulfide]] inside for lifelong lubrication) very low wow, flutter and rumble figures were achieved.'),
	(78, '==== Direct drive system ====\\n{{Main|Direct-drive turntable}}\\n[[Direct-drive turntable]]s drive the platter directly without utilizing intermediate wheels, belts, or gears as part of a drive train. The platter functions as a motor armature. This requires good engineering, with advanced electronics for acceleration and speed control. [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita\'s]] [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] division introduced the first commercially successful direct drive platter, model SP10, in 1969, which was joined by the [[Technics SL-1200]] turntable, in 1972. Its updated model, SL-1200MK2, released in 1978, had a stronger motor, a convenient [[pitch control]] slider for [[beatmatching]] and a stylus illuminator, which made it the long standing favourite among disc jockeys (\'\'see \\"[[Turntablism]]\\"\'\'). By the beginnings of the 80s, lowering of costs in microcontroller electronics made direct drive turntables more affordable.'),
	(79, '==== Pricing ====\\n[[Audiophile]] grade turntables start at a few hundred dollars and range upwards of $100,000, depending on the complexity and quality of design and manufacture. The common view is that there are diminishing returns with an increase in price - a turntable costing $1,000 would not sound significantly better than a turntable costing $500; nevertheless, there exists a large choice of expensive turntables despite vinyl records being long past their peak in popularity as replay media.'),
	(80, '== Pickup systems ==<!--[[Phono cartridge]] and [[Phonograph cartridge]] redirect here-->\\n[[Image:NadelAufPlatte.JPG|thumb|right|Typical magnetic cartridge]]'),
	(81, '=== Piezoelectric (crystal\\/ceramic) cartridges ===\\nEarly electronic phonographs used a [[piezoelectricity|piezo-electric]] \'\'\'[[crystal]]\'\'\' for pickup, where the mechanical movement of the [[stylus]] in the groove generates a proportional electrical [[voltage]] by creating stress within a crystal (typically [[Potassium sodium tartrate|Rochelle salt]]). Crystal pickups are relatively robust, and produce a substantial signal level which requires only a modest amount of further amplification. The output is not very linear however, introducing unwanted [[distortion]]. It is difficult to make a crystal pickup suitable for quality [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] reproduction, as the stiff coupling between the crystal and the long styli used prevent close tracking of the needle to the groove modulations. This tends to increase wear on the record, and introduces more distortion. Another problem is with the nature of the crystal itself: it is hydroscopic and tries to absorb moisture from the air and dissolve in it. So it needed protection from the environment by embedding it in other materials, without hindering the movement of the pickup mechanism itself. After a number of years, the protective jelly often deteriorated or leaked from the cartridge case and the full unit needed replacement.'),
	(82, '=== Magnetic cartridges ===\\n{{Main|Magnetic cartridge}}\\nThere are two common designs for magnetic cartridges, moving [[magnet]] (MM) and moving coil (MC) (originally called \'\'dynamic\'\'). Both operate on the same [[physics]] principle of [[electromagnetic induction]]. The moving magnet type was by far the most common and more robust of the two, though audiophiles often claim that the moving coil system yields higher fidelity sound.'),
	(83, 'In either type, the [[stylus]] itself, usually of diamond, is mounted on a tiny metal strut called a cantilever, which is suspended using a collar of highly compliant plastic. This gives the stylus the freedom to move in any direction. On the other end of the cantilever is mounted a tiny permanent [[magnet]] (moving magnet type) or a set of tiny wound coils (moving coil type). The magnet is close to a set of fixed pick-up coils, or the moving coils are held within a [[magnetic field]] generated by fixed permanent magnets. In either case, the movement of the stylus as it tracks the grooves of a record causes a fluctuating magnetic field which causes a small electrical current to be induced in the coils. This current closely follows the sound waveform cut into the record, and may be transmitted by wires to an [[electronic amplifier]] where it is processed and amplified in order to drive a [[loudspeaker]].  Depending upon the amplifier design, a phono-preamp may be necessary.'),
	(84, 'In most moving magnet designs, the stylus itself is detachable from the rest of the cartridge so it can easily be replaced. There are three primary types of cartridge mounts.  The most common type is attached using two small screws to a [[headshell]] which then plugs into the tonearm, while another is a standardized \\"P-mount\\" or \\"T4P\\" cartridge (invented by [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] in 1980 and adopted by other manufacturers) that plugs directly into the tonearm. Many P-mount cartridges come with adapters to allow them to be mounted to a headshell. The third type is used mainly in cartridges designed for DJ use and it has a standard round headshell connector. Some [[mass market]] turntables use a proprietary integrated cartridge which cannot be upgraded.'),
	(85, 'An alternative design is the \'\'moving iron\'\' variation on moving magnet used by ADC, [[Grado Labs|Grado]], [[Stanton Magnetics|Stanton]] 681 series, [[Ortofon]] OM and VMS series, and the [[Moving Micro Cross|MMC cartridge]] of [[Bang & Olufsen]]. In these units, the magnet itself sits behind the four coils and magnetises the cores of all four coils. The moving iron cross at the other end of the coils varies the gaps between itself and each of these cores, according to its movements. These variations lead to voltage variations as described above.'),
	(86, 'Famous brands for magnetic cartridges are: [[Grado Labs|Grado]], Stanton\\/Pickering (681EE\\/EEE), B&O (MM types for its two, non-compatible generations of parallel arm design), [[Shure]] (V15 Type I to V), [[Audio-Technica]], Nagaoka, [[Ortofon]], Technics, [[Denon]] and ADC.'),
	(87, '=== Strain-Gauge cartridges ===\\n[[Strain gauge]] or \\"semiconductor\\" cartridges do not generate a voltage, but act like a variable resistor, whose resistance directly depends on the movement of the stylus. Thus, the cartridge \\"modulates\\" an external voltage supplied by the (special) preamp. These pickups were marketed by Euphonics, Sao Win, and Panasonic\\/Technics, amongst others.'),
	(88, '=== Optical readout ===\\nA few specialist [[laser turntable]]s read the groove optically using a laser pickup.  Since there is no physical contact with the record, no wear is incurred. However, this \\"no wear\\" advantage is debatable, since vinyl records have been tested to withstand even 1200 plays with no significant audio degradation, provided that it is played with a high quality cartridge and that the surfaces are clean.<ref>Loescher, Long-Term Durability of Pickup Diamonds and Records, Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, vol 22, issue 10, pp 800<\\/ref>'),

	(91, 'Different materials for the stylus have been used over time. Thomas Edison introduced the use of [[sapphire]] in 1892 and the use of [[diamond]] in 1910 for his cylinder phonographs. The Edison [[Edison Disc Record|diamond disc]] players (1912\\u20131929), when properly played, hardly ever required the stylus to be changed. The latter stylus for vinyl records were also made out of sapphire or diamond. A specific case is the specific stylus type of [[Bang & Olufsen]]\'s (B&O) moving magnet cartridge MMC 20CL, mostly used in parallel arm B&O turntables in the 4002\\/6000 series. It uses a sapphire stem on which a diamond tip is fixed by a special adhesive. A stylus tip mass as low as 0.3 milligram is the result and full tracking only requires 1&nbsp;gram of stylus force, reducing record wear even further. Maximum distortion (2nd harmonic) fell below 0.6%.'),
	(92, 'Other than the Edison models, early disc players (such as external horn phonographs or internal horn \\"Victrola\\" style models) required the use of exchangeable needles.  The most common material was steel, although other materials such as copper, [[tungsten]], fibre, and cactus needles were used.  These needles needed to be replaced often due to the forces exerted by the record. Early advertisements implored customers to replace their steel needles after each record side. Steel needles were sold in packets that varied due to their thickness and length.  Thick, shorter needles produced strong loud tones while thinner, longer needles produces softer, muted tones. In 1916, [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] introduced their tungsten-tipped \\"Tungs-Tone\\" brand extra longplay needle which was advertised to play between 100 and 300 records. At the end of acoustic 78 rpm, \\"longplay\\" hardened steel needles came on the market, which were advertised to play 10-20 sides on a single disc.'),
	(93, 'A keel-shaped diamond stylus appeared as a byproduct of the invention of the [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED Videodisc]].

	(94, 'Since the late 1950s, almost all phono input stages have used the [[RIAA equalization]] standard. Before settling on that standard, there were many different equalizations in use, including EMI, HMV, Columbia, Decca FFRR, NAB, Ortho, BBC transcription, etc. Recordings made using these other equalization schemes will typically sound odd if they are played through a RIAA-equalized preamplifier. High-performance (so-called \\"multicurve disc\\") preamps, which include multiple, selectable equalizations, are no longer commonly available. However, some vintage preamps, such as the [[LEAK]] varislope series, are still obtainable and can be refurbished.

	(95, 'Prices vary largely: the well known and extremely popular high-end S-type SME-arm of the 1970-1980 era not only possessed a complicated design, but was also very costly. On the other hand, even some cheaper arms could be professional quality: The \\"All Balance\\" arm made by a now defunct Dutch company, \\"Acoustical\\" was only \\u20ac30 [equivalent]. It was used in that period by all official radio stations in the Dutch Broadcast studio facilities of the NOS, as well as by the pirate radio station [[Radio Veronica|Veronica]]. Playing records from a boat in international waters, the arm had to withstand sudden ship movements. Anecdotes indicate this low cost arm was the only one capable of keeping the needle firmly in the groove during heavy storms at sea.'),
	(96, 'Basic arm design has changed relatively little. S-type tonearms can be found on even the early 1925 [[Victor Orthophonic phonograph|Victor Orthophonic Victrola]]. Though early electrical pickup tonearms were light, their full weight rested on the record. This created the \'\'tracking force\'\' required to transmit accurately to the crystal pickups of the day, with relatively stiff styli. Friction resulted, and record wear was high. As better technologies emerged (such as magnetic cartridges), far smaller tracking forces became possible, and the \'\'balanced arm\'\' came into use. Quality arms employ an adjustable [[counterweight]] to offset the mass of the arm and various cartridges and headshells. On this counterweight, a calibrated dial enables easy adjustment of stylus force. After perfectly balancing the arm, the dial itself is \\"zeroed\\"; the stylus force can then be dialed in by screwing the counterweight towards the fulcrum. (Sometimes a separate spring or smaller weight provides fine tuning.) Stylus forces of 10 to 20 [[Newton (unit)|mN]] (1 to 2 [[gram-force|grams-force]]) are typical for modern consumer turntables, while forces of up to 50&nbsp;mN (5&nbsp;grams) are common for the tougher environmental demands of party deejaying or turntablism. \\nOf special adjustment consideration, Stanton cartridges of the 681EE(E) series [and others like them] feature a small record brush ahead of the cartridge. The upforce of this brush, and its added drag require compensation of both tracking force (add 1&nbsp;gram) and anti-skating adjustment values (see next paragraph for description).'),
	(97, 'Even on a perfectly flat LP, tonearms are prone to two types of tracking errors that affect the sound. As the tonearm tracks the groove, the stylus exerts a frictional force [[tangent]] to the arc of the groove, and since this force does not intersect the tone arm pivot, a clockwise rotational force (moment) occurs and a reaction \'\'\'skating force\'\'\' is exerted on the stylus by the record groove wall away from center of the disc. Modern arms provide an \'\'\'anti-skate\'\'\' mechanism, using springs, hanging weights, or magnets to produce an offsetting counter-clockwise force at the pivot, making the net lateral force on the groove walls near zero. \\nThe second error occurs as the arm sweeps in an arc across the disc, causing the angle between the cartridge head and groove to change slightly.  A change in angle, albeit small, will have a detrimental effect (especially with stereo recordings) by creating different forces on the two groove walls, as well as a slight timing shift between left\\/right channels. Making the arm longer to reduce this angle is a partial solution, but less than ideal. A longer arm weighs more, and only an infinitely long [pivoted] arm would reduce the error to zero. Some designs (Burne-Jones, and Garrard \\"Zero\\" series) use dual arms in a parallelogram arrangement, pivoting the cartridge head to maintain a constant angle as it moves across the record. Unfortunately this \\"solution\\" creates more problems than it solves, compromising rigidity and creating sources of unwanted noise.'),
	(98, '=== Linear Tracking ===\\nIf the arm is \'\'\'not\'\'\' pivoted, but instead carries the stylus along a radius of the disc, there is no skating force and little to no cartridge angle error. Such arms are known as \'\'\'linear tracking\'\'\' or \'\'tangential\'\' arms. These are driven along a track by various means, from strings and pulleys, to worm gears or electromagnets. The cartridge\'s position is usually regulated by an electronic [[servomechanism]] or mechanical interface, moving the stylus properly over the groove as the record plays, and\\/or for song selection.'),
	(99, 'Early developments in linear turntables were from Rek-O-Kut (portable lathe\\/phonograph) and Ortho-Sonic in the 1950s, and Acoustical in the early \'60s.

An enclosed bridge-like assembly is swung into place from the platter\'s right edge to its middle. Once in place, a short tonearm under this \\"bridge\\" plays the record, driven across laterally by a motor.

The publishing company (or a collection society operating on behalf of many such publishers, songwriters and composers) collects fees (known as \\"[[royalties#Music royalties|publishing royalties]]\\") when the composition is used. A portion of the royalties are paid by the publishing company to the copyright owner, depending on the terms of the contract. Typically (although not universally), the publishing company will provide the owner with an advance against future earnings when the publishing contract is signed. A publishing company will also promote the compositions, such as by acquiring song \\"placements\\" on [[television]] or in [[film]]s.'),
	(120, '====Recordings====\\nRecordings are created by [[recording artist]]s, often with the assistance of [[record producer]]s and [[audio engineer]]s. They were traditionally made in [[recording studio]]s (who are paid a daily or hourly rate) in a [[recording session]]. In the 21st century, advances in recording technology have allowed many producers and artists to create \\"[[home studio]]s\\", bypassing the traditional role of the recording studio. The [[record producer]] oversees all aspects of the recording, making many of the logistic, financial and artistic decisions in cooperation with the artist. [[Audio engineer]]s (including [[recording engineer|recording]], [[mixing engineer|mixing]] and [[mastering engineer]]s) are responsible for the audio quality of the recording.  A recording session may also require the services of an [[arranger]] or [[studio musician]]s. '),
	(121, 'Recordings are (traditionally) owned by [[record companies]]. A [[recording contract]] specifies the business relationship between a recording artist and the record company. In a traditional contract, the company provides an advance to the artist who agrees to record music that will be owned by the company. The [[A&R]] department of a record company is responsible for finding new talent and overseeing the recording process. The company pays for the recording costs and the cost of [[radio promotion|promoting]] and [[marketing]] the record. For physical media (such as [[compact disc|CD]]s), the company also pays to [[manufacture]] and [[distribution (business)|distribute]] the physical recordings. Smaller record companies (known as \\"[[independent record label|indies]]\\") will form business relationships with other companies to handle many of these tasks. If contractually bound to do so, the record company pays the recording artist a portion of the income from the sale of the recordings, generally known as a [[royalties#Music royalties|mechanical royalty]]. (This is distinct from the publishing royalty, described above.) This portion is similar to a percentage, but may be limited or expanded by a number of factors (such as free goods, recoupable expenses, bonuses, etc.) that are specified by the record contract. Session musicians and orchestra members (as well as a few recording artists in special markets) are under contract to provide [[work for hire]]; they\'re typically only paid one-time fees or regular wages for their services, rather than royalties.'),
	(122, '====Physical media====\\nPhysical media (such as CDs) are sold by music [[retail]]ers and are owned by the consumer. A music distributor delivers the physical media from the manufacturer to the retailer and maintains relationships with retailers and record companies. The music retailer pays the distributor, who in turn pays the [[record company]] for the recordings. The record company pays mechanical royalties to the publisher, composer, and songwriter via a collection society. The record company then pays royalties, if contractually obligated, to the recording artist. In the case of digital downloads, there is no physical media other than the consumer\'s hard drive. The distributor is optional in this situation; large online shops may pay the labels directly, but digital distributors do exist to service vendors large and small. When purchasing digital downloads, the consumer may be required to agree to record company and vendor licensing terms beyond those which are inherent in copyright; for example, some may allow freely sharing the recording, but others may restrict the user to storing the music on a specific number of hard drives.'),
	(123, '====Other uses of recorded music and compositions====\\n[[Sheet music]] provides an income stream that is paid exclusively to the [[composer]]s and their [[publishing company]]. When a recording is broadcast (either on radio or by a service such as [[Muzak]]), [[performance rights organisation]]s (such as the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] in the US, SOCAN in Canada, or [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] and [[PRS for Music|PRS]] in the UK), collect a third type of royalty known as a [[performance royalty]], which is paid to composers and recording artists. This royalty is typically much smaller than publishing or mechanical royalties. When recordings are used in [[television]] and [[film]], the composer and their publishing company are typically paid through a [[synchronization rights|synchronization license]]. Subscription services (such as [[Rhapsody]]) also provide an income stream directly to record companies, and through them, to artists, contracts permitting.'),
	(124, 'In addition to these traditional business relationships, new ways of doing business are being developed in the 21st century. The traditional lines that once divided artist, publisher, record company, distributor, retail and consumer electronics have become blurred. Artists may own their own publishing companies, [[artist manager|artist management]] companies may promote and market recordings on behalf of their clients, artists may promote and market themselves using only free services such as [[YouTube]] or [[social media]], [[consumer electronics]] companies have become [[Online music store|digital music retailer]]s, and so on, in many variations. New digital music distribution technologies have also forced both government and industry to re-examine the definitions of intellectual property and the rights of all the parties involved.'),
	(125, 'A [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] brings together a performing artist and a [[Music venue|venue]] owner and arranges contracts. A [[booking agency]] represents the artist to promoters, makes deals and books performances. Consumers usually buy tickets either from the venue or from a ticket distribution service such as [[Ticketmaster]]. In the US, [[Live Nation]] is the dominant company in all of these roles: they own most of the large venues in the US, they are the largest promoter, and they own [[Ticketmaster]].'),

However, in the 21st century, it has become more common to release recordings to promote tours, rather than book tours to promote records.'),

This is headed by a [[tour manager]] and provides [[stage lighting]], [[Audio engineering|live sound reinforcement]], [[guitar technician|musical instrument tuning and maintenance]] and transportation. On large tours, the road crew may also include an accountant, stage manager and catering. Local crews are typically hired to help move equipment on and off stage.

Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high [[electric current]] drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. In 1878, Edison applied the term \'\'[[Electrical filament|filament]]\'\' to the [[electrical element|element]] of glowing wire carrying the current, although the English inventor [[Joseph Swan]] had used the term prior to this. Swan developed an incandescent light with a long lasting filament at about the same time as Edison, as Swan\'s earlier bulbs lacked the high resistance needed to be an effective part of an electrical utility. Edison and his co-workers set about the task of creating longer-lasting bulbs. In Britain, Joseph Swan had been able to obtain a patent on the incandescent lamp; though Edison had already been making successful lamps for some time, his patent application was incompletely prepared and failed.<ref name=\\"Israel1\\">Israel, Paul B. 1998.
